Use Ink to help you build themes and plugins for Jekyll.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/octopress/ink.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/octopress/ink)

### Features
- Installing Ink plugins is easy.
- Users won't need to install or manage plugin assets.
- Jekyll will read your plugin's layouts, javascripts, stylesheets and more directly from your gem.
- Ink allows users to modify a theme or plugin by adding a modified version to source/_custom directory.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'octopress-ink'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install octopress-ink

## Usage

This is still evolving quite a bit. If you want to use it, you
should probably talk to me directly.

## Contributing

For right now. Talk to me directly. I'd love help thinking
through some of this stuff. Pretty soon, build a theme or a plugin and tell me what's broken.
