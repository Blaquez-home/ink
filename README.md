# Octopress ThemeKit

Use Themekit to help you build themes and plugins for Jekyll.

### Features
- Installing ThemeKit plugins is easy.
- Users won't need to install or managae plugin assets.
- Jekyll will read your plugin's layouts, javascripts, stylesheets and more directly from your gem.
- ThemeKit allows users to modify a theme/plugin by adding their modified version to _themes directory.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'octopress-themekit'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install octopress-themekit

## Usage

This is still evolving quite a bit. If you want to use it, you
should probably talk to me directly.

## Roadmap
- Add theme/plugin include tag (probably named embed)
- Add support for fonts, images and misc asset.
- Write an example theme
- Write an example plugin
- Add support for Sass (probably a separate plugin).
- Add support for compiling and stitching javascript/coffeescript.
- Ensure Guard Jekyll Plus handles assets properly.

## Contributing

For right now. Talk to me directly. I'd love help thinking
through some of this stuff. Pretty soon, build a theme or a plugin and tell me what's broken.
